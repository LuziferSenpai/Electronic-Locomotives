# Electronic-Locomotives

This modification adds 2 new locomotives to the game, that use electricity as fuel.
You need to place __Providers__ so, that the locomotives get fuel.
With better technology, the locomotives get faster to top speed and have a faster top speed.
Adds 4 more [Braking force](https://wiki.factorio.com/Braking_force_(research)) technologies to the game.
